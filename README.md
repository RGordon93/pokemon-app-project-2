# Let's Go Poke Moves! App
Let's Go Poke Moves! is a web application for searching pokemon moves and abilities.
### Motivation 
As an avid pokemon gamer myself, I thought it would be fun and useful to make this application for fans and people who would be interested in knowing all of the possible moves one pokemon can learn.

### Code Style
- Html, Css, Javascript

### Tech/Framework used 
- React.js, React Router, React Router Dom, React Video Player & Poke API



### Installation 
NPM, Create React App

### API Reference 
- https://pokeapi.co/


## How to use? 
The page will first load the home screen, welcoming the user. The user has the option to click the search tab to explore any pokemon of their choice, through a pokedex listing or filtered search. The results will display an image of the pokemon selected -- the name, abilities and the moves.
